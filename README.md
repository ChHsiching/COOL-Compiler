## Project Overview
This is a simple implementation of a **COOL (Classroom Object-Oriented Language)** compiler, designed to compile COOL programs into MIPS assembly code. The project aims to serve as a learning tool for understanding compiler construction and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Project Goals
- Implement a basic COOL language compiler.
- Output MIPS assembly code that can be run on a MIPS simulator.
- Provide a practical example for learning compiler principles.

## Current Status
- The project is in its initial phase with no implemented code yet.
- The next steps will involve setting up the basic compiler framework.

## Installation & Usage
Once the project is completed, follow these steps to run the compiler:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the source code.
3. Run the generated assembly code using a MIPS simulator.

## TODO
- [ ] Set up the basic project framework.
- [ ] Implement the lexer and parser for COOL language.
- [ ] Generate MIPS assembly code.
- [ ] Add test cases for validation.
